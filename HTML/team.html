                                    After earning a Ph.D. in Geography from Pennsylvania State University in 2007 and then spending a year teaching at Bucknell University, Matt Kelley came to UW Tacoma.<br>
                                    He directs and teaches in the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Certificate Program, where his teaching focuses largely on the application of geospatial technologies and geographic information systems to urban social and environmental problems. His research is similarly focused on the role that emerging technologies can play in the urban community development process.<br>
                                    He has worked extensively with community organizations in Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Tacoma to think creatively about utilizing digital tools in their day-to-day operations, to both improve the effectiveness of their outcomes and amplify the voices and knowledge of local residents.<br>
                                    Dr. Kelley's recent research activities have aimed to engage critically with the ways that conventional spatial data are used to represent, and mis-represent, distressed urban neighborhoods.

                                    He when not staring at Census data spreadsheets, he likes to contemplate on the existance of boundaries and speculate on interactions at social and phsical edges.<br>
